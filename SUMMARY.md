**A Dataset of Laryngeal Endoscopic Images for Semantic Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 536 images with 2939 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *vocal folds*, *void*, *glottal space*, and other: *other tissue*, *intubation*, *surgical tool*, and *pathology*.

Images in the Laryngeal Endoscopic dataset have . All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, each image contains information about its sequence(***seq1***, ***seq2***, ***seq3***, ***seq4***, ***seq5***, ***seq6***, ***seq7***, ***seq8*** tags) and ***patient1*** or ***patient2*** number. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Institute of Mechatronic Systems, Hannover, Germany.
