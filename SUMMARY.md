**A Dataset of Laryngeal Endoscopic Images for Semantic Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 536 images with 2939 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *vocal folds*, *void*, *glottal space*, and other: *other tissue*, *intubation*, *surgical tool*, and *pathology*.

Images in the Laryngeal Endoscopic dataset have . All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 6 sequences: ***seq8*** (186 images), ***seq7*** (122 images), ***seq4*** (66 images), ***seq6*** (44 images), ***seq3*** (26 images), and ***seq5*** (26 images). Additionally, every image marked with the ***patient*** tag (1 or 2). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Institute of Mechatronic Systems, Hannover, Germany.
