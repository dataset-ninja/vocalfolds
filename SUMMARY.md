**A Dataset of Laryngeal Endoscopic Images for Semantic Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 536 images with 3578 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *vocal folds*, *glottal space*, *other tissue*, and other: *intubation*, *surgical tool*, *void*, and *pathology*.

Images in the Laryngeal Endoscopic dataset have . All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, each image contains information about its ***sequence*** and ***patient*** number. Explore it in supervisely supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Institute of Mechatronic Systems, Hannover, Germany.
